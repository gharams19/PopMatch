### What was done with commit links and descriptions:

**Eden Avivi** - 

Started implementing the Firebase Auth API calls for login and sign up screens, added a custom pop up for resetting the password in the login view which send a custom email to the user's email through Firebase and has the steps to reset there.

Finished up the login and sign up view controllers by adding tap recognizers and text field return functions.

Started working on the lobby view controller and came up with a specific animation that might be used later for other parts.

Commits: (I had some merging problems with master, so some of my commits are on Wai Hei Ngan's account since he helped with the merge)

### Plan to do:

**Eden Avivi** - 
Continue working on the lobby view controller by:
* Researching animation in xcode
* Researching how to know how many users are in a specific view controller
* Start implementing and animating if previous steps are possible
