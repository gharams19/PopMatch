**Eden Avivi** - Testing plan for milestone 1 https://github.com/ECS189E/project-w21-big-bang-theory/blob/Eden/Testing_Plan.md
Started working on log in and sign up screens by creating the xcode project, applying constraints on view controllers to fit smaller phones, verification of several coditions such as all text fields full before pressing a button, hide/show password components and etc. Also started working on an API.swift file but then looked into Firebase and decided we do not need this file for now.
