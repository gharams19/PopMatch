### What was done with commit links and descriptions:

**Eden Avivi** - 
* This week I mostly did formatting changes with Ma, fixing bugs and practicing for the demo.
* I succeeded in implementing the bubbles to fit the number of users online and limit it between 5 to 30 bubbles so the screen will not be empty, but this interrupted with the matching algorithm so it had to be taken down and might be used in the future. 
* In addition, I added a sound when a match is found in the lobbyVC. 
* Also, I tried to make an animation for the premeeting screen but the conversion between After Effects and xcode does not support the particles I used to animate the bubbles.
